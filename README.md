## üöÄ Quick Start  

### Installation  

Install Co-Agent from PyPI using the following command:  

```bash
pip install coagent-framework
```  


### Usage  

#### Console Workflow  

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step example for using Co-Agent via the console:  

```python
from co_agent import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, llm_config
from co_agent import scraper

# Setting up the Google Gemini LLM API key
llm_config["api_key"] = "Your_Google_API_Key"

# Initializing the scraper
blog_scraper = scraper.BlogScraper(name="blog_scraper")
blog_scraper.scrape()   

# Initialize agents (Assistant and User Proxy)
print("Multi-Agent Chat started:")

assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant", llm_config=llm_config)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", assistant=assistant)

# Process blog content for LinkedIn
summary = user_proxy.initiate_postmaking_process("blog_1")
```  

#### Streamlit UI  
To use Co-Agent with an interactive interface, visit the Streamlit app here:
üëâ https://co-agent.streamlit.app/

Simply enter the blog URL in the provided field, and the app will guide you through the process of generating a LinkedIn-ready post.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

### Core Components  

1. **Scraper Module**  
   The scraper fetches content from a user-provided blog URL, stripping unnecessary formatting while retaining essential information.  

2. **Multi-Agent System**  
   - **AssistantAgent:** Responsible for generating initial summaries from blog content.  
   - **UserProxyAgent:** Reviews and refines the summary based on user feedback and iterative collaboration.  

3. **LLM Integration**  
   Google Gemini, or a similar LLM, is used for understanding context, generating concise summaries, and formatting content.  

4. **Database Storage**  
   Approved summaries are stored in a database for later retrieval, ensuring content reusability.  

5. **Formatter**  
   Formats the final summary into a LinkedIn-ready post, including a headline, body, hashtags, and call-to-action links.

## üìä Example Output  

### Input  

Blog URL: [Viola-Jones Algorithm Blog](https://medium.com/@pvt.dhruvkumar/viola-jones-algorithm-a-miracle-5e10085aba50)  

### Output  

**Headline:**  
Viola-Jones Object Detection: A Revolutionary Leap in Computer Vision  

**Body:**  
Remember the early 2000s when real-time object detection felt like science fiction? That all changed thanks to the groundbreaking work of Viola and Jones! Their 2001 algorithm, a marvel of machine learning, used a boosted cascade of simple features (Haar-like features and AdaBoost) to achieve incredibly efficient object detection. This clever approach prioritized relevant features and quickly discarded irrelevant ones, making real-time face detection a reality ‚Äì a true game-changer!

This algorithm's impact is still felt today. Easily accessible via OpenCV, it continues to serve as a foundational element in many computer vision applications. Want to delve deeper into the magic behind this revolutionary technique?
